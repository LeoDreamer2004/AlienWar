# Alien Invasion
A game coded with Pygame when I was a python beginner.

## how to play
Just use ←→ key to move the airplane, and hold space to shoot the enemies! You can even get some props to help you stronger.

**WARNING:** As the project is the first try for me to finish program, the code may be highly complexed and has low readablity. Bugs may appear as well.
